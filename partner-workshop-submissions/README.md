Also, Dashboard is part of Snap-in, so it doesnâ€™t need any other code repo.
Guidelines:
- You just need to share the code repo with the snap-in. The dashboard should be part of the snap-in only.
- Screenshots of the setup and documentation are not required.
- There are no additional requirements.
- You should put the code in the repo and share it with us.
